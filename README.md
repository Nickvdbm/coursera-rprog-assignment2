# Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some benefit
# to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly. The
# following two functions are used to cache the inverse of a matrix.

# makeCacheMatrix creates a list containing a function to
# 1. set the value of the matrix
# 2. get the value of the matrix
# 3. set the value of inverse of the matrix
# 4. get the value of inverse of the matrix
